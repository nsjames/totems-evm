# Philosophy

I built Totems with a single goal:

> Create a permissionless, open protocol for programmable tokens that can sustain itself without "big daddy" crypto 
> telling us what toys we can play with and when.

## Open by design, not by accident

Totems is intentionally _**wide open**_.

- The core contracts are immutable.
- There are no admin keys.
- There is no upgrade path.
- There are no backdoors.
- There is no required UI.
- **_Everyone has equal access._**

Once deployed, the protocol belongs to *no one* and is usable by *anyone*.

This is not an oversight.  
It is the entire point.

Totems does not ask for trust.  
It removes the need for it.  
And through that, freedom.

## A neutral core

The protocol does not exist to pick winners.

Anyone can:
- Build a UI
- Earn referrer fees
- Create Mods
- Publish Mods
- Create Totems
- Automate usage through code

Totems does **_not_**:
- Set prices for creators
- Decide which assets succeed
- Decide which assets/mods can be created
- Participate in downstream value
- Custody funds
- Enforce outcomes
- Act as a counterparty

I did not build Totems with structural advantages baked into the system.  
Not for myself, and not for anyone else.

Totems does not protect or elevate incumbents or gatekeepers.  
**It eliminates them.**

---

## Explicit Tradeoffs

Totems does **not** attempt to solve:

- identity
- Sybil resistance
- fairness
- good behavior
- economic success

Those are social problems, not technical ones.  
It is up to UIs, and participants to solve them.

---

## A level playing field

There are no protocol-level levers I can pull.
- No whitelists.
- No fee siphons.
- No hidden extraction.
- **No special treatment.**

Once deployed, the protocol is immutably neutral, and for me to personally benefit from the project I must play in the same 
level playing field as everyone else by creating value to its participants (UIs, mods, tools, etc).

---

## Built to be built on

Most people are afraid of competition.  
**_I want competition._**

- Create your own UIs. 
- Integrate Totems into your existing products.
- Integrate with other protocols.
- Build mods.
- Build tools.
- Let your mind run wild.

If I end up evaporating into obscurity as other better builders rise above my contributions, that is not failure.

**That is proof it worked.**
